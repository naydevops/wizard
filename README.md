## üêπ About The Project

Wizard101 was released in September 2008 but, in all of its history, it has had no ability to pre-download every file to your system like other video games.

Pre-downloading your files allows:
* **Better Performance:** No delays or lag caused by downloading assets on the go.
* **No Data Limits:** Avoid internet usage spikes or data caps from streaming.
* **Faster Load Times:** Local files mean quicker loading and smoother transitions.
